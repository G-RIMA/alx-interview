This is a project for a technical interview in alx
Here I created a function that returns a list of intehers representing the pascal triangle on n.
Pascals Triangle
Properties of a pascal triangle are:
1. Each number in pascals triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it
2. Numbers in a row are symmetric in nature
3. Each number represents a binomial coefficient.
4. Numbers on the left and right are always 1
5. the nth row contains (n+1) numbers in it

Using a formula we use nCr formula which is:
n! / (n-r)!r!

if we use this formula we get, if n is 5: 
0C0
1C0 1C1
2C0 2C1 2C2
3C0 3C1 3C2 3C3
4C0 4C1 4C2 4C3 4C4
5C0 5C1 5C2 5C3 5C4 5C5

with this information we created the code in this directory.
